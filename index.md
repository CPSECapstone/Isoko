## Welcome to Isoko!

Despite making up 32% of the population, ethnic minorities own only 18% of businesses in the United States, and 99% of these businesses are small businesses. Additionally, women make up more than half of the population and represent only 19% of business owners, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community represent less than 1% of business owners. In order to help these minority business owners gain more traction and create an easy and accessible way for people to invest in individuals and their communities, we are creating a web application that allows users to search for businesses in their area that offer specific products and are owned by members of specific minority groups.
