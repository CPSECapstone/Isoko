2021 Software Engineering Capstone - AWS Minority Owned Business Team

## Overview
Despite making up 32% of the population, ethnic minorities own only 18% of businesses in the United States, and 99% of these businesses are small businesses. Additionally, women make up more than half of the population and represent only 19% of business owners, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community represent less than 1% of business owners. In order to help these minority business owners gain more traction and create an easy and accessible way for people to invest in individuals and their communities, we are creating a web application that allows users to search for businesses in their area that offer specific products and are owned by members of specific minority groups. 

## Vision Statements
#### For Business Owners
For business owners who are minorities the Minority Markets (Application)  is a web application that displays various minority owned businesses unlike Yelp/Google, our product strives to increase traction for minority owned businesses specifically .

#### For Consumers
For minority and socially conscious consumers who are looking to support minority owned businesses the Minority Markets is a web application that displays various minority owned businesses unlike Yelp/Google, our product is not oversaturated and serves a specific need to find a variety of minority group owned businesses.
